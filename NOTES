The structure of FuzzyTools at the moment is tied a bit too tightly to the kernel selection. For instance, mGMMjetsparams not only references the cluster type in the name (Gaussian Mixture Model), but consists of a series of covariance matrices. I'm not sure of the best way to decouple this at the moment while still making things as easy as possible for the client. 

Also, the interface functions are not consistent because they treat the weights, the cluster parameters, and the cluster locations differently (two are modified by reference, one is returned as a vector).

Some strange memory problems seem to abound in the code... Segfaults occasionally, but has stopped for the moment.
