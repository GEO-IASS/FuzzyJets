TMVA:
        This week was entirely devoted to getting TMVA working so that we can be more certain of our results. Initially I prepared for this by looking through the example analyses and reading the TMVA user guide (which is incredibly long). When it came time to actually produce code and get things working, I first had to figure out how to provide event reweighting information to TMVA. This amounted to getting another branch into the data trees we use for our analysis, but this turned out not to be so feasible, as it was quite slow and I didn't want to endanger data by modifying it. The solution that I found was to put the weighting information in another tree and use tree friendships to simulate the data extension. These files have a suffix _w relative to their accompanying .root files.
        Actually making the TMVA analysis run took a while, but now I have a more or less declarative syntax for doing MVA so long as I don't want to do too much reconfiguration of the TMVA::Factory object. So far I'm just using KNN for the MVA, as the properties of KNN are well understood, but I don't think it would be too much effort to play around with other options.
