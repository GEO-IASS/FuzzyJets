Pathologies and features for mGMMc jets:
On the basis of number of jets, not events


NPV 0, EJS 0, Offset 0, TBS 0
    # excessive jet overlap/coaxility (mostly same size): 9
    # two jet splitting (mostly same size): 22
    # overlapping shape learning (different sizes or locations): 25 (not a pathology)
    Most problematic events: 3, 12, 13, 17, 21, 25, 26, 28

NPV 0, EJS 0.01, Offset -2, TBS 0
    # No particles clustered to jets: 1 + a few others with just one or two jets
    # excessive jet overlap/coaxility (mostly same size): 1
    # two jet splitting (mostly same size): 4
    # overlapping shape learning (different sizes or locations): 8
    Most problematic events: 3, 12, 49

NPV 0, EJS 0.01, Offset -5, TBS 0
    # No particles clustered to jets: 6 + many others with just one or two jets
    # excessive jet overlap/coaxility (mostly same size): 0
    # two jet splitting (mostly same size): 1
    # overlapping shape learning (different sizes or locations): 7
    Most problematic events: 3, 12, 26, 27, 32, 37
    
NPV 20, EJS 0, Offset 0, TBS 0
    # excessive jet overlap/coaxility (mostly same size): 4
    # two jet splitting (mostly same size): 11

NPV 20, EJS 0.01, Offset 0, TBS 0
    # No particles clustered to jets: 48! This is very surprising to me.

NPV 20, EJS 0.005, Offset 0, TBS 0
    # No particles clustered to jets: 43! Wow. Strange that we still get correction of r distribution...
